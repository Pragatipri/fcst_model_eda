# Machine Learning-Based Hybrid Sales Forecasting Model for Retail Financial Planning 

## Aim
To develop a machine learning–based hybrid sales forecasting framework for the retail sector that improves accuracy, reduces human bias, and supports financial planning through scenario modelling and comparative analysis of forecasting methods.

## Objectives
This project focuses on one of the objectives of the project:

Acquire and prepare a retail dataset. Conduct EDA.

Compile or generate ~10k+ sales records at SKU and category levels.
Clean, transform, and engineer features
Ensure the dataset is suitable for hierarchical forecasting.

## Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting

I am using the “Superstore Sales Dataset” from Kaggle, which contains transactional data for a company selling three primary product categories: Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies. Customers are grouped into three segments — Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office — based on their purchasing behaviour and assumed business profile.
